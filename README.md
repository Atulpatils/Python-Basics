# Keywords and Identifiers in Python

In Python, keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning to the interpreter. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. Identifiers, on the other hand, are names that are given to variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. They are user-defined and can be used to represent any object in Python.

Here are some of the key differences between keywords and identifiers in Python:

Keywords are predefined and cannot be changed. Identifiers can be created by the user and can be anything that follows the identifier naming rules.
Keywords are case-sensitive. Identifiers are case-insensitive, except for the first letter.
Keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier. Identifiers can be used as variable names, function names, class names, module names, etc.

Here are some of the rules for naming identifiers in Python:

Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
Identifiers can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
Identifiers cannot be keywords.
Identifiers are case-insensitive, except for the first letter.
